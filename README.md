input examples: 
1. Check claim CLM-2026-022. Why was it rejected? Can we approve it?
2. Member LAYA-1002 has multiple claims. Are any of them rejected incorrectly based on our policies?
3. John Doe submitted a €150 physiotherapy claim. Check if he's already used up his annual physio benefits and tell me how much we should approve.

Laya Healthcare AI Claims Agent
Autonomous AI system that investigates rejected medical claims, cross-references policy documents, finds missing referrals, and auto-approves valid claims in 10 seconds.

Overview
This system revolutionizes medical claims processing by:

🔍 Intelligent Investigation - Automatically finds and analyzes rejected claims

📋 Policy Analysis - Semantic search across 100+ policy documents using vector embeddings

📄 Document Discovery - Finds missing GP referrals in member document archives

✅ Self-Healing - Autonomously approves wrongly rejected claims

🧠 Explainable AI - Complete reasoning trace for GDPR/HIPAA compliance

⚡ 10x Faster - Reduces processing time from 3 days → 10 seconds

Test it live: https://aipoweredmedicalclaims.vercel.app

Ask the agent: "Check claim CLM-2026-022. If rejected, investigate why and approve if possible."

🔄 How It Works - Complete Flow
User Query Processing
text
User: "Check claim CLM-2026-022 and approve if possible"
Step 1: Query Reception

text
Frontend (React) → FastAPI → LangGraph → GPT-4o
Step 2: First AI Decision

text
GPT-4o thinks: "User wants claim CLM-2026-022. I need to search for it."
Action: Call search_claims tool
Step 3: Database Query

text
LangGraph → tools.py → Azure SQL
SQL Query: SELECT * FROM claims WHERE claim_id = 'CLM-2026-022'
Result: Status = REJECTED, Reason = "Missing GP referral"
Step 4: Second AI Decision

text
GPT-4o thinks: "Claim is rejected for missing GP referral. 
User asked if we can approve it. I need to check policy rules."
Action: Call search_policies tool
Step 5: Policy Search

text
LangGraph → tools.py → Azure AI Search
Vector Search: "physiotherapy GP referral requirements"
Result: "GP referral required within 30 days of treatment"
Step 6: Third AI Decision

text
GPT-4o thinks: "Policy requires referral within 30 days. 
Claim rejected for missing it. But maybe it exists and was missed?"
Action: Call search_member_documents tool
Step 7: Document Discovery

text
LangGraph → tools.py → Cosmos DB
Query: Find documents for member LAYA-1002 type="referral"
Result: Found GP_Referral_20260103.pdf dated January 3, 2026
Step 8: Final AI Decision

text
GPT-4o analyzes:
- Treatment date: January 5, 2026
- Referral date: January 3, 2026
- Time difference: 2 days ✅ (within 30-day policy)
Conclusion: Claim wrongly rejected! Approve it.
Action: Call update_claim_status tool
Step 9: Database Update

text
LangGraph → tools.py → Azure SQL
UPDATE claims SET status='APPROVED', assessed_amount=30.00
Result: Claim updated successfully
Step 10: User Response

text
GPT-4o: "Claim CLM-2026-022 has been APPROVED for €30.00.
Why rejected: Missing GP referral
Why approved: I found the referral dated Jan 3, 2026 in 
member documents, which is within the 30-day policy requirement."

🤖 Core Components
1. FastAPI Backend (main.py)
python
@app.post("/api/query")
async def query_agent(request: QueryRequest):
    # Receives user queries
    # Calls LangGraph agent
    # Returns AI response
   
3. LangGraph Agent (agent.py)
python
# Orchestrates tool calls
# Manages conversation state
# Routes between GPT-4o and tools

3. Custom Tools (tools.py)
Tool	Database	Purpose
search_claims	Azure SQL	Find claims by ID/member
get_member_profile	Cosmos DB	Retrieve member information
search_policies	AI Search	Semantic policy search
search_member_documents	Cosmos DB	Find referrals/receipts
update_claim_status	Azure SQL	Approve/reject claims

5. AI Brain (GPT-4o)
Reads user queries
Decides which tools to call
Analyzes results
Makes approval decisions
Generates explanations
